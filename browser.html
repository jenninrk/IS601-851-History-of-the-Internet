        <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
        <p class="text-center"><img src="pics/html.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet browser was first developed by a University of Illinois student named Mark Andreesen.  Mark knew the power and usefulness of the world wide web but realized the average person would have a hard time leveraging it.  He had the idea for a simple point and click interface to harness the power of the internet and he called the project Mosaic.  The distribution and popularization of Mosaic began as a small beta effort and grew exponentially by word of mouth.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February of 1994 a wildly successful entrepreneur named Jim Clark reached out to Mark.  Jim was a Silicon Valley icon, already having successfully created a profitable software company called Silicon graphics.  Jim recognized the brilliance of what Mark had created and envisioned it having commercial applications.  Their shared vision and a handful of programmers Mark knew from his university began the creation of Mosaic Communications Corporation which later became Netscape Communications.  Jim brought the whole team out to Silicon Valley and their immediate goal was to launch a new iteration of Mosaic as quickly as possible.  He knew that while the idea of a web browser was revolutionary the implementation was something that could be replicated and in technology culture being first to market was critically important</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 13th of October in 1994 the company launched Netscape Navigator.  It was an instant runaway success which made the company a major player and a threat to the software industries current goliath, Microsoft.  Up until that point Bill Gates had underestimated the importance of the Internet but the popularity of Netscape opened his eyes to the future.  Bill wrote a memo to his entire company stating that competing in the space was the newest and most important initiative at the organization.   Soon after that there was a famous meeting between Microsoft and Netscape, the details of which are heavily disputed.  Microsoft claims to have had a very cordial conversation about the potential collaboration between the two companies but Netscape drew a much darker picture of events.  Netscape claimed they were made a lowball, $1 million, offer for all their code or Microsoft would retaliate by creating a competing software that copied all the functionality of Navigator.  Netscape immediately responded to the perceived threat by having their lawyer Gary Reback alert the US Justice department and anticipating further antagonistic behavior Gary started drafting an anti-trust lawsuit.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buzz about Netscape had now reached Wall St and the company’s founder decided to take the company public.  Despite the short existence of the company and nonexistent profits it became one of the most successful IPOs of all time.  The employees were riding high on their recent success but they were about to have a tremendous challenge ahead of them.  Microsoft had called a press conference and announced they were developing their own web browser to compete with Navigator and they called it Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft knew it was behind in the race to capture internet browser market share but while their team of engineers worked round the clock to make their software competitive, they unleashed their other major weapon.  Microsoft had tremendous power and influence; entire companies depended on their relationship with them to survive.  PC manufacturers such as Compaq shipped computers that ran the Windows operating system and without that software they were out of business.  The sales teams at Microsoft threatened not to renew licensing deals if companies wouldn’t agree to stop shipping Netscape Navigator.  These tactics proved very effective and the use of Internet Explorer slowly increased.  The final and perhaps most extraordinary move on Microsoft’s part was, in order it strike a blow to Netscape’s bottom line, decided to give IE away for free.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the release of Internet Explorer 4.0 in September of 1997 the browser war was pretty much over.  IE had a market share north of 80% and Netscape was floundering.  Netscape would later be sold off to another huge corporation, AOL, and their founder’s dreams of controlling the Internet were over.  However, while Microsoft may have been celebrating victory over its software competition it was about to do battle with an even tougher adversary, the US government.  The investigation into the various underhanded practices Microsoft was employing uncovered some damning evidence and painted Bill Gates himself as a villain.  The federal judge ultimately ruled against Microsoft and ordered that the company be broken up.  While that decision was ultimately determined to be to harsh by an appeals court and the company did not have to be dismantled, Bill Gates did have to relinquish his position as CEO to Steve Balmer.</p>
