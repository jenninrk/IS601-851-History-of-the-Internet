        <h1>Internet Search</h1>
        <p class="text-center"><img src="pics/internet_search.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The internet has provided tremendous uplift to commerce, research, education, connection – nearly every area of life in the United States today has improved with the advent of the internet.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing users access to billions and billions of servers and data repositories around the world, there is virtually no limit to the information even the most casual user can gain access to with only a simple PC and an internet connection. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, without search capability provided by a search engine, the internet would be virtually unusable, as a manual server by server search for information would be both unwieldy and too time consuming to be useful on any level. Without the ability to index or sort information, this high tech innovation is rendered entirely useless. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the late nineties near Silicon Valley in Southern California, two grad students at Stanford University, David Filo and Jerry Yang, who were simply trying to find some data to use in making player selections in a Fantasy Basketball league, stumbled upon a process for building a directory of services for use in internet searches that developed into the platform that would ultimately become what we know today as the Yahoo! Search engine. Originally called “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web”, the rudimentary search tool operated by simply grouping data into like subjects, narrowing the searchers efforts down to fewer sites, rather than having to read through lines and lines of document names looking for something that matched their needs. Jerry and David were astounded when shortly after creating the tool, users from all over the country began to reach out to them to get access.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assured of the need for such a tool and the obvious desirability of having same, the big question that Jerry and David faced was how to monetize the tool, in order to justify the expense of development, and ultimately to create a business around it. Attempts to fund the startup business came to nothing until Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, a well known tech VC fund in Southern California, suggested the sale of advertising on the landing pages as a possible option to source capital from operations. Though Filo and Yang wanted very much to find a way to earn revenue from their idea, they were not convinced that users would want to see advertising on all their searches.  What they did not count on was that the reduction in the pain caused by the effort required to search for information on the web was more than offset by merely having to look at advertising in the process .  Users were willing to tolerate it. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, also in Silicon Valley, Excite.com was also developing a search engine, but one that was based on actual code, rather than simply sorting and listing website and document titles in a directory.  This became a fundamental building block of what would become the search engines of today.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in Silicon Valley, another company which would become Google, founded by Sergei Brin and Larry Page, also of Stanford University,  found that by prioritizing the most hit on pages allowed them to further refine and qualify the search effort, yielding better results for the user.  Realizing that the number of hits was a relative statement of value placed on a particular site by other searchers, this “in-link count” became part of the search algorithm that is also a major component of today’s most popular search engines.  It was even so popular when first rolled out back in the late nineties/early 2000s, that Brin and Page almost crashed the entire Stanford University data network, and were forced to relocate their business operations off campus.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As search engine companies began to consolidate, another well known tech VC capitalist from Kousla Ventures, determined that the code of Excite.com coupled with Google’s prioritization based on in-link counts would be a powerful combination, sought to arrange a marriage between the two companies, but Excite decided to walk away.  They could have bought Google – a company currently worth over $200 billion, for $1 million.  </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, additional opportunities to monetize data gathered from users generated additional revenue opportunities in addition to the sale of advertising space on landing pages. The Google team realized that by gathering individual search preferences – today gathered through the use of “cookies” – effectively allowed the search engine provider to build each user’s individual profile of preferences based on where and what they were searching.  This information became valuable marketing data that could be used or sold in marketing services directly to end users. This concept was further fleshed out when Google partnered with Bill Gross, an advertising specialist who helped market Overture.  Though a partnership did not develop between Google and Overture, later a very similarly structured Google Ad Words product, which allows customer to structure ad copy in such a way as to yield optimal results when potential clients search for their products. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this development of a search engine proved not only revolutionary for the internet, as it drove more consumer usage and therefore added utility, but it was highly lucrative for all these search engine companies, and particularly Google, whose IPO in August of 2004 generated almost $3 billion in investments. Google CEO Eric Schmidt garnered significant blowback from Wall Street, as his end around method of issuing the IPO shares effectively cut Wall Street out of profits, but further solidified Googles reputation as a maverick organization that thinks out of the box and contributes great value to users.  It also helped pave the way back for many in the tech community, who were still reeling and trying to recover from the dot com bubble burst of 2000.</p>
