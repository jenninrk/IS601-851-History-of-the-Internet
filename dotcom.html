        <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
        <p class="text-center"><img src="pics/dotcom_bubble_pic.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitalism in the United States underwent a seismic transformation In the 90’s, at the intersection of technological advancements, and the formation of two major companies who utilized technology as the core of their business model:  Amazon and EBay. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This shift in how Americans transacted business – from shopping in brick and mortar stores, to ordering online, - created an economic boom, followed by the dot com bubble, and ultimately the bust that served as the set up for the recession of the mid 2000s. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The companies who were at the center of the economic boom, Amazon and EBay, had slightly different business models.  Amazon, started in a garage by Jeff Bezos in 1995, and began as an online marketplace whose chief offer was books, which were ordered by consumers online and shipped around the globe. Later expanding to other commodities, Amazon experienced unprecedented growth that was never before seen in retail history. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ebay, founded by Pierre Omidyar, similarly began as an online business in 1995, but instead of selling new products like Amazon, EBay instead was an online marketplace, where people could sell pre-owned collectibles, like china, jewelry, and Beanie Babies (a hot investment of that time) in an auction like format.  Both companies relied upon the internet as their primary store front, and the personal computer as the POS terminal through which the transaction was generated.  And the rate of growth of these new online outlets far outpaced any previous growth observed by other transformational business models.  It took almost 13 years for the TV set to replicate in most American homes, but it took only 4 years for the Internet to add 50 million users, all of whom could be clients.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two technologies which made these online storefronts possible: one, the advent of semiconductor technology that brought computerization down to scale and making adoption by consumers possible, and two, the networking of those same computers, which generated the momentum to increase the speed of adoption of those computers.  Because consumers could now own computers that were small enough to fit on a desk or a table, more consumers were able to acquire this technology. And, as each new computer owner became a new “node” on the internet “network”, those additional nodes increased the overall utility of the network, as the number of possible connections increased exponentially. This further encouraged additional consumers to become adopters of computers.  In this manner, the internet was built. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so the economic boom as we define it began.  With scale achieved with computer users and an increasingly ubiquitous network available for commerce, the table was set for Bezos and Omidyar to establish their companies using this newly developed infrastructure to engage clients. And, as with all startups, the rush from investors, VC capital companies, and Wall Street was on.  With the IPO of Netscape in 1995, Yahoo in 1996, and finally Amazon in 1997, the rush to fund the establishment of these and other companies built on these breakthrough technologies  was on, creating the dot com bubble. And Wall Street fueled the fire, with analysts like Henry Blodgett singing the praises of these darlings of the new eCommerce economy, encouraging further investment in the new tech companies springing up.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rush to investment and growth, however, led to profligate spending, as money was everywhere.  Flush with money, many entrepreneurs were making poor business decisions. New dot com companies were flourishing, representing well over 50% of the 480 IPOs added in 1999 alone (only 159 total IPO’s were added in 2019). In 2000, over $40 million was spent on dot com ads during the Super Bowl, with a 30 second slot alone garnering over $2.2 million.  At one point, so much fiber network was being laid – often redundantly – that Dow Corning, an major manufacturer of fiber cable in Ithaca, New York, actually ran out of glass with which to manufacture fiber cable, and orders went unfilled for months.   </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these and other clear signs of impending doom, however, and unbeknown to many participants in this economic windfall, the party was soon to be over. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two events precipitated the financial bust that followed the dot com boom: one, Henry Blodgett, the Wall Street analyst who had been recommending so many of the dot com buys, had been maintaining a correspondence file of emails wherein he candidly described how many of the new dot com companies were simply insubstantial and not meritorious of investment, and two, Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, had decided the rapid investment on internet stocks was making the overall economy unstable, and decided to slow it down by raising interest rates. Thus in March 2000, the stock market, fueled by speculation, easily available capital, and inflated investor confidence, crashed, and lost 10% of it’s value over the next few weeks.  This crash caused numerous tech businesses to shutter, costing thousands their jobs, and ultimately costing  investors over $5 trillion over the next two years. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shareholders blamed Wall Street for their losses, and the search for the guilty began.  The scrupulous email trail kept by Henry Blodgett became his undoing. Attorney General Elliot Spitzer of New York indicted him for securities fraud, given that he had documented that he knew many dot com companies were not worth their market valuation, yet recommended them to investors as a buy anyway.  As a result, thousands of Americans had to rebuild their lives, their careers, and their savings.  So much loss from the rush to jump on the dot com gravy train, that ended like so many other “gold rushes” of before – the telegraph, the railroad, the automobile, even Wall Street itself.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that loss was perhaps necessary for the set up of the ‘Golden Age” of the internet we are experiencing even today.  The rush to reduce the size of the computer, to lay the fiber network that is the backbone of the internet today, and to build many other attendant technologies that support eCommerce, and hastened the use of technology by the average consumer, has revolutionized the American economy in ways that benefit all Americans today.  The cost to investors, businesses, and consumers in building that new economy can perhaps best be considered the price of entry which we all currently enjoy. </p>
