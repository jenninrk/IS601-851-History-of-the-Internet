        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human beings have as their deepest need the need to communicate.  Historically, information exchanged has been governed by large media sources, such as television, newspaper, and radio. Media moguls and editors told us what to consume, and when and where we could consume it.  We were largely at the mercy of information as presented through their filter.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet, also known as the World Wide Web, has revolutionized how we consume information. With outlets such as You Tube, Facebook, and numerous others, media is now more interactive with individuals, more one on one and customizable that ever before, and it is changing what we see and how we see it. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This revolution, or Web 2.0, is being led by young leaders of startups, such as Chad Hurley of YouTube, Jay Edelson of Digg, are two such leaders at the forefront of the revolution who see how the power of the individual can be expanded and accessed through web enablement, and who are creating businesses that use web services as a powerful alternative to old school media outlets. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; News is one area on which Web 2.0 has had a major impact. Television, a long standing media stalwart, is very exclusive with it’s membership, and hard to break into.  Radio and newspaper are very similar, very heavily moneyed and controlled by large conglomerates and boards of directors. The #metoo movement of today is a group of women who as an example were required to compromise their own personal morals and values in an effort to break into these organizations.  </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, the Web 2.0 outlets of today do not have similar barriers to news contributors.   You Tube’s tag line is “Broadcast, yourself”, and their business model is centered around putting power into the hands of the people – the consumers – who are also themselves the audience.   Similarly, DIGG provides the news without the filter of an editor. Consumers again vote on the news. And FaceBook founder Mark Zuckerberg started the company as a relationship tool which has evolved into an advertising and marketing platform, monetizing the relationships and personal information documented there for retailers to use in targeting products and services to niche markets. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music, and it’s acquisition, is another area which has been revolutionized by the World Wide Web, and specifically Web 2.0.  Previously, anyone desiring to acquire a track of music they liked had to travel to a record store to buy an album, only to find out it had only one good song on it.  In the web enabled version of music, however, the acquisition is far different.  New technology that enabled the compression of large and otherwise unwieldy music files, called MP3,  made music, specifically single trach music, shareable across the internet from user to user.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This concept was made widely available by a company called Napster, whose CEO Sean Fanning made music “shareable”, much like EBay, where music owners could share owned music files and acquire music for free in this manner. The Record Industry of America, and several lawyers took exception to what they saw this as a violation of intellectual property rights, and effectively sued Napster and put them out of business.  This declaration of war, though they thought it was against a business, was really against it’s consumer base, who did not appreciate this.  And it did not slow the sharing of electronic music, nor did it shoe up already falling sales of hard media recordings.  It merely drove these entrepreneurs to find other legal ways of satisfying a consumer base and monetizing the sale of music without the attendant hard media on which it was recorded. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar issue was taken by media giant Viacom against You Tube, who it saw as engaging in copyright infringement, in uploading clips and video recordings to it’s “channels”.  Again, the act of suing the consumer did not have the desired effect, and YouTube has continued to offer copies of content, together with user uploaded contect, effectively opening up a new distribution channel for such media as consumers demand. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value of these social one to one channels continues to grow, so much so that MySpace was purchased by Rupert Murdoch’s Newscorp in 2005 for $650 million dollars, and Microsoft recently invested close to $240 million dollars for a mere 1.6% of Facebook, clearly recognizing the high value potential of the then under development advertising platform, and attendant marketing intel available from all the associated users. </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Craig’s List,  literally an online classifieds section, and Blogs, literally an online Editorials section, has similarly dipped into the classic venue of the newspaper, and the opportunity to develop collaborative content, much like open source software, is another avenue these web tools provide to users, by effectively returning to the read/write type of collaboration, but with the added essence of remote access capability.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these new media options available through Web 2.0 are viable living proof that the web belongs to us, and how we interact, create, and obtain information will also change with it. </p>
