        <h1>The Invention of the Internet</h1>
        <p class="text-center"><img src="pics/invention_pic.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet is now a staple of world-wide communication, connecting billions of people all over the globe but it went through an incredible journey from its infancy to what exists today.  Computers used to be standalone independent entities that needed in-person interaction to feed in commands on materials like punch cards.  It was at MIT that a man named Leonard Kleinrock started experimenting data transmission with an idea called queuing.  Queuing was a simple but effective method for keeping track of and managing data as it traversed a network.  There were two principles governing this theory, the first being demand access which would only provide resources to a particular request until it was needed which allowed the system to effectively share resources. The second principle was a distributed control system where no single authority would control the entire network.  This was a huge step forward in design from the existing circuit switching design of the telephone networks that required a direct dedicated connection between two parties.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political climate played a role in the urgency to develop this technology further.  The telephone system was considered vulnerable to attack that would leave our government and military in a compromised position.  Paul Baran was tasked with find a way to take these theories and create a truly indestructible network.    Paul and his team came up with some key innovations that paved the way for the current network protocols used today.  They determined that in order to get from one end to the other without failing it would need to use a “hot potato” routing method where as it traveled from node to node it could determine an available route.  In order to make this system more effective they decided to break the overall message into smaller sections called “packets” each with a header telling the network where it needed to go, that way if a route failed during the transmission the trailing packets could take another path and meet up at the destination.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966, Bob Taylor at ARPA decided to tackle one of the big outstanding issues facing computer engineers.  Computers systems were very unique and had no universal way of communicating with one another.  The idea of chaining these computers directly would create a scaling issue that each one would need to know how to talk to all of the others and every time a new type of system was built it that new system would need to be integrated.  The solution they arrived at was to place a special purpose computer called a Interface Message Processor next to each mainframe that would handle the communication.  This simplified the overall network and increased adoption because it could be done without interfering with the development of the mainframes themselves.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t till 1968 that Larry Roberts started searching for the engineers that would build out ARPANET which would become the first wide-area packet switching network with distributed control and a clear predecessor to the Internet.  The major players such as the telecoms and IBM had major investments of their own in this space and did not see any value in undertaking this project so it ultimately went to a small company in Cambridge, Massachusetts called Bolt Bernak and Newman Inc or BBN.  They started work on the project on Jan 1 1969 and had only 9 months to deliver a working prototype.  The team was successful and by April 1971 ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked into a network that spanned coast to coast.  </p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARPANET was a successful project and a useful tool but like many technology advancements or platforms was still waiting for the application that turns it into a game changer.  This “killer” application for ARPANET was, of course, e-mail.  Raymond Tomlinson was toying with an application to send messages to other users on the timesharing computer he was currently working with when he had an epiphany that same fundamentals could be applied to a send message across the network.  This would be the first of many groundbreaking applications that launched the internet into a mainstream necessity.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of ARPANET birthed many other networks and while packet switching was being used there was no standard by which it was implemented so these various networks remained independent entities.  Many different ideas were proposed but unless a unified architecture was agreed upon the world would never have a single Internet.  It took almost 10 years of development and negotiations but finally in 1983 TCP/IP was adopted as the universal standard.  This was a watershed moment in the history of networking technology.  What followed was another critical decision but this time not one in the realm of science.  On June 9th 1992 congressed passed a bill making this technology available to the public.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this technology was unleashed to the public there was still a high barrier to entry.  A user required a fair bit of computer knowledge to be able to do things and locate resources, there wasn’t an easy way to navigate what was out there.  A researcher out of CERN named Tim Berners-Lee wanted to find a way to better define connections between data.  The crisscrossing nature of these connections which he called threads reminded him of a web so he dubbed his creation the World Wide Web.  It provided users a way to connect data through links that could be easily followed which allowed them to traverse different files with ease.  This laid the groundwork for Mark Andreesen at the University of Illinois to create the world’s first web browser.  A piece of software created a graphical user interface that a user could handle data in a few different protocols.  This piece of software which he called Mosaic was eventually commercialized as Netscape Navigator.   Finally, all the pieces were in place to allow the average person to experience the internet.</p>
